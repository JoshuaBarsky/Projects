This file will have a description of each project given during my time in CSE101 at UC Santa Cruz. 
A ".h" file will be given as well as a README that briefly describes each project worked on. 
Due to not wanting to provide answers to assignments, I will only be providing what's mentioned. 
Please do ask if you would like to see a demo.

All projects are written in C or C++.
